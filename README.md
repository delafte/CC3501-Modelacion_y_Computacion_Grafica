## CC3501-Modelacion_y_Computacion_Grafica
In this repository i have the assignments i did for the CC3501 course during the first semester of 2023. The central idea was to create spaceships projects in a 2D and 3D enviroment with textures, lightning, interactions, etc.

The "grafica" directory has files that were given to us in the course for us to work with.

#### For those i used:
